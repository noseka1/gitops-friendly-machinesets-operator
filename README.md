# GitOps-Friendly MachineSets Operator

This operator allows the user to manage MachineSets without the need to supply the cluster-specific infrastructure name. Infrastructure name is unique to the OpenShift cluster. It is generated by the OpenShift installer and is not known prior to the cluster installation. This operator injects the infrastructure name into MachineSets automatically.
